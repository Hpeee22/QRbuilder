# QR-Code-Generation-Project
QR Code Generator using NodeJS! 

Throughout this project, I dived into the intriguing world of QR codes - those 2D barcodes that you can effortlessly scan with your phone to direct to any URL. My objective was to build a powerful tool that enables users to generate QR codes from any URL they can imagine.

I leveraged the power of two essential NodeJS packages - Inquirer and QR Image. Inquirer facilitated user input from the terminal, while QR Image effortlessly transformed the user-provided URL into a stunning QR code image, saved as a PNG file.

The process was both enlightening and challenging. I explored npm packages, honed my skills in modern JavaScript syntax, and interacted with the File System module in NodeJS to save user input in a text file for future reference.
